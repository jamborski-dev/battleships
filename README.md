# battleships
This is my implementation of a classic battleships game in vanilla JS.

All the basic mechanics of creating a new game, setting fleets for the user and 'AI' and actual game stage are implemented.

Features yet to come:

 - 8-bit styling 
 - online mode

If you are here and have any thoughts about the quality of my code or just how to make it better, please let me know! :)
